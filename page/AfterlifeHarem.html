            <p>- Short Game Description: A game based on the afterlife, and guiding souls. </p>
            <p>- Who I'd Recommend This To: If you enjoy a "lure" like story, characters with special-like abilities, repeatable cutscenes, having the ability to impact relationships with other characters inside the game, and enjoy in game mechanics to unlock/earn items </p>
